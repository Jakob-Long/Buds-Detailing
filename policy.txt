Customers of Bud's Detailing are welcome to drop off their vehicles for up to 48 hours to allow us to complete the detailing service.
- Drop-off times can be scheduled during our regular business hours, Monday to Saturday. Exceptions can be made for special circumstances, such as emergency repairs or last-minute travel.
- Vehicles must be reasonably clean and free of personal belongings before drop-off. Any personal items found in the vehicle will be kept in a secure location until pickup.
- Vehicles with mechanical or structural issues that may affect the detailing process will be accepted for drop-off. Any critically damaged structural issues affected in the detailing process will be repaired or paid for in full by me. Customers will be advised to address these issues prior to scheduling a detailing appointment.
- Customers must sign a release form upon drop-off, acknowledging that they understand the terms of the policy and agree to allow our team to work on their vehicle for up to 48 hours.
- I will make every effort to complete the detailing service within the allotted time frame. However, if unforeseen circumstances arise, such as inclement weather or equipment malfunction, we may need to extend the time for completing the job. In such cases, we will inform the customer as soon as possible and adjust the drop-off and pickup dates accordingly.
- Customers will be responsible for making arrangements for their transportation during the drop-off and pickup periods. We will not provide any loaner vehicles or transportation services.
- Payment for the detailing service must be made in full at the time of pickup. Any additional fees or services requested during the detailing process must also be paid before the vehicle can be released.
- Customers who fail to pick up their vehicle within 24 hours of completion will incur a daily storage fee until the vehicle is picked up. We reserve the right to take legal action to recover the vehicle and any outstanding fees if the vehicle is abandoned for more than 30 days.
- We strive to provide high-quality service and customer satisfaction. If a customer is not satisfied with the results of the detailing service, we will make every effort to address their concerns and provide a satisfactory resolution. Customer feedback and suggestions are always welcome and valued.
